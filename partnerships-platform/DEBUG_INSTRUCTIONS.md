# üîç DEBUG INSTRUCTIONS: Solving the 404 API Issue

## üö® CURRENT STATUS
- ‚úÖ All environment variables correctly configured
- ‚úÖ Same API key as working contact-form
- ‚úÖ Same token format and headers
- ‚ùå Still getting 404 "page is invalid" from Buycycle API

## üìã STEP-BY-STEP DEBUGGING

### Step 1: Deploy the Enhanced Debug Code
1. **Commit and push** the changes I just made to your video-platform
2. **Wait for Vercel deployment** to complete
3. The enhanced logging will show detailed request/response information

### Step 2: Test the Debug Comparison Endpoint
After deployment, test the new debug endpoint:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_TOKEN with a real custom_auth_token from localStorage
curl -H "X-Custom-Authorization: YOUR_TOKEN" \
     https://sponsorship.buycycle.com/api/debug-compare
```

This will test:
- ‚úÖ V3 endpoints (should work)
- ‚ùå V4 user endpoint (currently failing)  
- ‚ùå V4 orders endpoint (test if other v4 endpoints work)
- ‚ùå V4 POST method (test if it's a method issue)

### Step 3: Compare with Contact-Form
In your contact-form, create a similar test to compare results:

```javascript
// In contact-form, test the same endpoints
const token = localStorage.getItem('custom_auth_token');

// Test V4 user endpoint from contact-form
fetch('/api/user', {
  headers: { 'X-Custom-Authorization': token }
})
.then(r => r.json())
.then(data => console.log('Contact-form V4 result:', data));
```

### Step 4: Analyze the Differences
Look for differences in:
1. **Response status codes**
2. **Response headers** 
3. **Response body content**
4. **Error messages**

## üîç POSSIBLE ROOT CAUSES

### Theory 1: Deployment Environment Differences
**Hypothesis**: Different deployment environments have different API access

**Test**: Compare IP addresses and deployment regions
```bash
# Check video-platform IP
curl https://sponsorship.buycycle.com/api/debug-compare

# Check contact-form IP  
curl https://contact.buycycle.com/api/user
```

### Theory 2: API Key Context/Scope Differences
**Hypothesis**: Same API key behaves differently in different contexts

**Test**: Use the debug endpoint to see exact request details

### Theory 3: Request Timing or Rate Limiting
**Hypothesis**: Rapid requests are being rate limited

**Test**: Add delays between requests

### Theory 4: Hidden Header or Configuration Differences
**Hypothesis**: There's a subtle difference we haven't found yet

**Test**: Compare ALL request headers from both systems

## üéØ EXPECTED DEBUG OUTPUT

After running the debug endpoint, you should see:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-XX...",
  "token_info": {
    "length": 36,
    "format": "ca382f0c-7749-11ef-8...",
    "type": "custom_auth_token"
  },
  "api_key_info": {
    "length": 64,
    "format": "WmhamrdVBtY1MHoJLBwQ..."
  },
  "tests": [
    {
      "test": "V3_refresh_endpoint",
      "status": 400,
      "success": "Expected - wrong token format"
    },
    {
      "test": "V4_user_endpoint", 
      "status": 404,     // ‚ùå This is the problem
      "body": "Not Found",
      "success": false
    },
    {
      "test": "V4_orders_endpoint",
      "status": "???",   // üîç Will this also be 404?
      "success": "???"
    }
  ]
}
```

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS BASED ON RESULTS

### If V4 orders endpoint ALSO returns 404:
- **Root cause**: API key lacks ALL v4 permissions
- **Solution**: Contact Buycycle to upgrade API key permissions

### If V4 orders endpoint WORKS but user endpoint fails:
- **Root cause**: Specific endpoint permission issue
- **Solution**: Use alternative endpoint or request permission

### If ALL endpoints work in debug but vote still fails:
- **Root cause**: Issue in vote logic flow
- **Solution**: Debug the vote request flow specifically

## üìû EMERGENCY WORKAROUND

If we can't fix the v4 endpoint, we can use v3 endpoints temporarily:

```typescript
// Fallback to v3 endpoint for user data
const response = await fetch('https://api.buycycle.com/en/api/v3/me', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${authToken}`,  // Use auth_token instead
    'X-Proxy-Authorization': apiKey
  }
});
```

## üéØ GOAL

By the end of this debugging session, we should know:
1. **Exact error response** from Buycycle API
2. **Whether other v4 endpoints work**
3. **Specific difference** between working and failing systems
4. **Clear path to resolution**

Run the debug endpoint and share the results - this will give us the definitive answer! üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
